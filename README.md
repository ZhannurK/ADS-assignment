## Description

This repository serves as a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. 
Each algorithm and data structure is contained within its own Java file and is well-documented to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following algorithms have been implemented:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: Recursive and iterative implementations to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Recursive and iterative implementations to generate Fibonacci numbers.
3. **Prime Number Check**: A method to determine whether a given number is prime or composite.
4. **Power Calculation**: Recursive and iterative implementations to calculate the power of a number.
5. **Reverse Array**: A method to reverse the elements of an array.
6. **String Digit Check**: A method to check if a given string contains only digits.
7. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: Recursive implementation to calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose m).
8. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation**: Recursive implementation to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

## How to Use

To use any of the implemented algorithms or data structures, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the desired algorithm or data structure implementation.
3. Open the corresponding Java file in your preferred Java development environment.
4. Compile and run the Java file to execute the algorithm or data structure.
